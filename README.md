# machineLearningProject
Create a machine learning classification model using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and Neural Network.
Both KNN and and Neural Networks were created from scratch using Java.
Created the Matrix class with helper methods to help make the Neural Network. Neural Network has one hidden layer.
This project was created to learn the basics of machine learning models and how they function.
